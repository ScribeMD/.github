GitHub Actions Starter Workflows and Default Community Health Files for ScribeMD

## Usage

### To use GitHub Actions workflows

- To use
  [starter workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization),
  please refer to
  [using starter workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/using-starter-workflows).
  We use [Octicons](https://primer.github.io/octicons/) v17.0.0 for their icons.

### To use community health files

- GitHub automatically uses the
  [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)
  housed here in [ScribeMD repositories](https://github.com/ScribeMD/).
- If you already have copies of the desired files, they will override the
  defaults found here unless deleted.
- The repository must be housed within
  [the ScribeMD organization](https://github.com/ScribeMD/). If it is not, you
  will need either to
  [transfer ownership](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository)
  or copy the desired files to your repository. In the latter case, changes will
  not propagate automatically.
